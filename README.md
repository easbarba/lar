# HOME
  GNU/Linux distributions CLI applications are configured with the so called
  dotfiles, version controlling those can lessen our daily burden greatly.
  
  This repostory follows $HOME structure so to easily mirror on a fresh
  installation.
  
  I have a limited , yet still functional, dotfiler *e_dots*, aiming minimal reproducibility features.

## .local/bin 
  Miscellaneous scripts to aid bootstrapping services, daily utilities Debian box, 
  usually written in bash, ruby and awk scripts.

## [GNU Guix](https://gnu.guix.org/)
  Eager to test projects experimental branches? heavily patched local builds?
  what about requiring specific deps? GNU Guix can help to achieve this goal in
  a rather sophisticated fashion, and all that easily achieved with a single file, just amazing. :)
