# HOME
  Linux distributions cli software are usually configured with dotfiles, version
  controlling those can lessen our daily burden greatly.
  
## .local/bin 
  Miscellaneous scripts to aid bootstrapping, setting up services and daily
  utilities.

## How
  This repostory follows $HOME structure so to easily mirror in a fresh
  installation, done so with the handy help of my limited dotfiler, *s-dots*, aiming
  minimal reproducibility features.
