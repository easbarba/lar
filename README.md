# HOME
  On *nix distributions, using software dotfiles to configure can lessen the daily
  burden, mine follows $HOME structure so to easily mirror late on a fresh
  installation.
  
  For now I use my own dotfiler *e_dots* to achieve a minimal reproducibility,
  but set to move on to Nix [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) soon.
   
## Documents
  To achieve a higher fixation of study, I heavily rely on annotations, and [org-mode](https://www.orgmode.org/features.html)  literate documents are just awesome at that.

## .local/bin 
  Scripts bundle to aid bootstrapping services, utilities on a Linux box, 
  usually bash, ruby and awk scripts.

## [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
  An interesting approach to try on experimental branches, heavily patch local builds, use different deps and so on is done in a sophisticate way with Nix, and all that easily achieved with a single file, just amazing. :)
