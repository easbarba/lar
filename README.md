# HOME
  Software dotfiles that I use daily, it follows $HOME structure to easily
  mirror late on in a freshly install, I use my own dotfiler *e_dots* to achieve a
  minimal reproducibility.
   
## Documents
  To achieve a higher fixation of study, I heavily rely on annotations and [org-mode](https://www.orgmode.org/features.html)  literate documents are just awesome at that.

## .local/bin 
  Miscellaneous scripts to aid bootstraping services, utilities on a Linux box, 
  usually bash, ruby and awk scripts.

## [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
  An interesting approach to try on experimental branches, heavily patch local builds, use different deps and so on is done in a sophisticate way with Nix, and all thata easily achieved with a single file, just amazing. :)
