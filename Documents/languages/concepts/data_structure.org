* Arrays
- fast reading
- slow linear searching
- keeps track of array size
 - the worst-case scenario of deleting an element is
   deleting the very first element of the array.
* Ordered Arrays
- kept in order

** insert
- needs to search/check the correct place
- search correct place, move to right and insert new one

** search
- linear search, binary search
- search stop once bigger number is reached
* Set
- does not allow duplicate values to be contained within it.
- fast reading
- slow linear searching
- keeps track of array size
- adding a new value requires searching whole set to check if it is not a
  existent value
