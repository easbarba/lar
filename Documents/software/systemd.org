#+TITLE: Systemd

systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When run as
first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that brings up
and maintains userspace services. Separate instances are started for
logged-in users to start their services.

When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a user
instance, systemd interprets the configuration file user.conf and the files in
user.conf.d directories. See systemd-system.conf(5) for more information.
