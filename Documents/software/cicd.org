* Concepts
** Continuous integration

is the process of collaborating on a shared code base, merging
disparate code changes into a version control system, and automatically creating and
testing builds.

** Continuous delivery
 is the process of automatically deploying builds to
nonproduction environments after the continuous integration process completes.

** Continuous deployment
closes the loop by deploying to live systems that serve real
users without any operator intervention.

** Pipelines
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps, called “stages,” that run in sequence.

* Gitlab
